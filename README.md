# Task-2-K-Means
Creating a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers based on their purchase history involves several steps. Hereâ€™s a detailed guide to implement this using Python:

Step-by-Step Implementation
Collect and Prepare Data

Gather customer purchase history data. This could include features like total amount spent, frequency of purchases, average purchase value, etc.
Clean the data to handle missing values and normalize it for better clustering results.
Choose the Number of Clusters (k)

Use techniques like the Elbow Method or Silhouette Analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Implement K-means Clustering

Apply the K-means algorithm to the prepared dataset.
Evaluate the Clustering Results

Analyze the clusters to ensure they make sense and improve if necessary.

Explanation
Data Loading and Preparation: We assume the data is in a CSV file with relevant columns. Missing values are handled by dropping rows with missing data.
Data Normalization: Using StandardScaler to normalize the data ensures that each feature contributes equally to the clustering process.
Determining Optimal Clusters: The find_optimal_clusters function uses both the Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis to help decide the best number of clusters.
Applying K-means Clustering: The optimal number of clusters is used to fit the K-means model. The cluster labels are then added to the original dataset.
Results Analysis and Visualization: The clusters are analyzed and visualized to understand the customer segments. The final data with cluster labels can be saved for further use.
